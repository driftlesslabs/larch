    "can be a simple table of data that is entirely in [idca](idca) (tall) or\n",

    "persons, tours, trips, skims, etc.).  It is generally reasonable to assemble \n",

    "The lower level of data organization is the `dataset`. This is a single \n",
    ":class:`xarray.Dataset` that is used in model estimation and application. The\n",
    "`dataset` is built from the `datatree` by selecting the data that is needed for\n",
    "a particular model, and then transforming it into the format that is required\n",
    "for the estimation or application of that model.  All of this is generally done\n",
    "automatically by larch, so most users will never need to see or interact with\n",
    "the `dataset` object directly.  Moreover, the `dataset` is generally not saved\n",
    "to disk, and will be recreated from the `datatree` whenever it is needed, or \n",
    "whenever the model structure is changed in any relevant way."
