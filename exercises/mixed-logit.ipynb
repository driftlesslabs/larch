    "  the coefficients. The negative sign in these cases is simply ignored, and\n",
    "  the standard deviation is the estimate without the negative sign. Here's\n",
    "  the reason: the parameter that is being estimated is not actually the standard\n",
    "  deviation; rather it is $W$ such that $W^2$ is the variance.  $W$ and $-W$\n",
    "  give the same variance, and hence are equivalent. Also, since the standard\n",
    "  deviation is defined as the square root of the variance, they give the same\n",

    "  standard deviation is that the optimization routine does not need to embody\n",

    "  that a random variable that is $N(B,W^2)$ is created as $B+w*\\mu$ where $\\mu$\n",
    "  is standard normal, or equivalently as $B-W*\\mu$: both result in a term with\n",
    "  mean $B$ and standard deviation $W$. An implication of this parameterization\n",
    "  is that the starting values of $W$ should not be set at 0, but rather at some\n",
    "  value slightly away from zero. The reason is this: Since $W$ and $-W$ are\n",
    "  equivalent, the true log likelihood is symmetric around $W=0$ and hence is\n",
    "  flat at $W=0$. (The simulated log likelihood is not exactly symmetric due\n",
    "  to simulation noise.) If $W=0$ were used as the starting values, the gradient\n",
    "  would be zero and the optimization routine would have no guidance on the\n",
    "  direction to move. (If you want, you can change the starting value for $W$\n",
    "  to zero, and rerun the model. You'll see that it has a smaller improvement\n",
    "  in the first iteration and takes more iterations to converge. "
